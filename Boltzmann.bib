abstract = {Section 8.2 presented the technique of estimating input probabilities of a process that are as unbiased as possible but consistent with known averages values of one or more quantities. This technique, the Principle of Maximum Entropy, was developed there for the simple case of one constraint and three input events, in which case the technique can be carried out analytically. It is described here for a more general case. 9.1 Problem Setup Before the Principle of Maximum Entropy can be used the problem domain must be set up. In cases involving physical systems, this means that the various states in which the system can exist need to be identified, and all the parameters involved in the constraints known. For example, this might include the energy, electric charge, and other quantities associated with each of the quantum states. In applications to nonphysical systems, the various possible events have to be enumerated and the properties of each determined, particularly the values associated with each of the constraints. It is not assumed in this step which particular state the system is actually in (which state is " occupied "). Indeed it is assumed that we cannot ever know this with certainty, so we deal instead with probabilities. In this Chapter we will apply the general mathematical derivation to two extremely simplified and crude examples, one a business model, and the other a model of a physical system.},

abstract = {Metabolite exchanges in microbial communities give rise to ecological interaction networks that influence ecosystem diversity and stability. These exchanges depend on complex intracellular pathways thus raising the question of whether ecological interactions are inferable from genomes. We address these questions by integrating genome-scale models of metabolism, to compute the fitness of interacting microbes, with evolutionary game theory, which uses these fitness values to infer evolutionarily stable interactions in multi-species microbial "games". After validating our approach using data on sucrose hydrolysis by S. cerevisiae, we performed over 80,000 in silico experiments to evaluate the rise of unidirectional and cross-feeding metabolic dependencies in populations of Escherichia coli secreting 189 amino acid pairs. We found that, despite the diversity of exchanged amino acids, most pairs conform to general patterns of inter-species interactions. However, several amino acid pairs deviate from these patterns due to pleiotropy and epistasis in metabolic pathways. To better understand the emergence of cross-feeding, we performed in silico invasion experiments and found possible evolutionary paths that could lead to such association. Overall, our study provides mechanistic insights into the rise of evolutionarily stable interdependencies, with important implications for biomedicine and microbiome engineering.},

Here, we examine the integrated regulation of central nitrogen metabolism in Escherichia coli through metabolomics and ordinary-differential-equation-based modeling. Metabolome changes triggered by modulating extracellular ammonium centered around two key intermediates in nitrogen assimilation, alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamine. Many other compounds retained concentration homeostasis, indicating isolation of concentration changes within a subset of the metabolome closely linked to the nutrient perturbation. In contrast to the view that saturated enzymes are insensitive to substrate concentration, competition for the active sites of saturated enzymes was found to be a key determinant of enzyme fluxes. Combined with covalent modification reactions controlling glutamine synthetase activity, such active-site competition was sufficient to explain and predict the complex dynamic response patterns of central nitrogen metabolites.},

abstract = {We established a theoretical framework for studying nonequilibrium networks with two distinct natures essential for characterizing the global probabilistic dynamics: the underlying potential landscape and the corresponding curl flux. We applied the idea to a biochemical oscillation network and found that the underlying potential landscape for the oscillation limit cycle has a distinct closed ring valley (Mexican hat-like) shape when the fluctuations are small. This global landscape structure leads to attractions of the system to the ring valley. On the ring, we found that the nonequilibrium flux is the driving force for oscillations. Therefore, both structured landscape and flux are needed to guarantee a robust oscillating network. The barrier height separating the oscillation ring and other areas derived from the landscape topography is shown to be correlated with the escaping time from the limit cycle attractor and provides a quantitative measure of the robustness for the network. The landscape becomes shallower and the closed ring valley shape structure becomes weaker (lower barrier height) with larger fluctuations. We observe that the period and the amplitude of the oscillations are more dispersed and oscillations become less coherent when the fluctuations increase. We also found that the entropy production of the whole network, characterizing the dissipation costs from the combined effects of both landscapes and fluxes, decreases when the fluctuations decrease. Therefore, less dissipation leads to more robust networks. Our approach is quite general and applicable to other networks, dynamical systems, and biological evolution. It can help in designing robust networks.},

@article{Vojinovic2009,
abstract = {Thermodynamic feasibility analysis (TFA) has been used as a tool capable of providing additional constraints to the mass balance-based methods of analysis of metabolic networks (e.g., flux balance analysis). Several publications have recently appeared in which TFA of different metabolic pathways from relatively simple to the genome-scale networks was described as a means of detecting the possible metabolic control steps. However, in order to perform TFA, many simplifying assumptions were necessary. On the other hand, it has been shown by applying TFA to the well-known pathway of glycolysis that erroneous simplifying assumptions may seriously bias the results of the analysis. A quantitative analysis of the influence of non-ideality of the biochemical system, pH, temperature, and complexation of the metabolites with Mg(2+) ions as well as a number of other factors on the TFA is reported. It is shown that the feasibility of glycolysis is very seriously limited by the reaction of oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde phosphate, and that the intracellular concentration of the main product of this reaction, biphosphoglycerate, must be anywhere from 10 to 100 times lower than published values. In addition, the driving force for this reaction, and consequently the feasibility of the entire pathway depend strongly on the intracellular pH and ionic strength and to a lesser extent on pMg and temperature. The analysis may also be influenced by uncertainties of the dissociation and magnesium complexation constants of glyceraldehyde phosphate. The analysis demonstrates the crucial importance of taking such factors into account when performing TFA. It also suggests an urgent need for experimental determinations of such factors as a prerequisite for sensible thermodynamic analysis of metabolism on a genome-wide scale.},

abstract = {Butyrate-producing bacteria have recently gained attention, since they are important for a healthy colon and when altered contribute to emerging diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and type II diabetes. This guild is polyphyletic and cannot be accurately detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Consequently, approaches targeting the terminal genes of the main butyrate-producing pathway have been developed. However, since additional pathways exist and alternative, newly recognized enzymes catalyzing the terminal reaction have been described, previous investigations are often incomplete. We undertook a broad analysis of butyrate-producing pathways and individual genes by screening 3,184 sequenced bacterial genomes from the Integrated Microbial Genome database. Genomes of 225 bacteria with a potential to produce butyrate were identified, including many previously unknown candidates. The majority of candidates belong to distinct families within the Firmicutes, but members of nine other phyla, especially from Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Thermotogae, were also identified as potential butyrate producers. The established gene catalogue (3,055 entries) was used to screen for butyrate synthesis pathways in 15 metagenomes derived from stool samples of healthy individuals provided by the HMP (Human Microbiome Project) consortium. A high percentage of total genomes exhibited a butyrate-producing pathway (mean, 19.1{\%}; range, 3.2{\%} to 39.4{\%}), where the acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) pathway was the most prevalent (mean, 79.7{\%} of all pathways), followed by the lysine pathway (mean, 11.2{\%}). Diversity analysis for the acetyl-CoA pathway showed that the same few firmicute groups associated with several Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were dominating in most individuals, whereas the other pathways were associated primarily with Bacteroidetes. IMPORTANCE Microbiome research has revealed new, important roles of our gut microbiota for maintaining health, but an understanding of effects of specific microbial functions on the host is in its infancy, partly because in-depth functional microbial analyses are rare and publicly available databases are often incomplete/misannotated. In this study, we focused on production of butyrate, the main energy source for colonocytes, which plays a critical role in health and disease. We have provided a complete database of genes from major known butyrate-producing pathways, using in-depth genomic analysis of publicly available genomes, filling an important gap to accurately assess the butyrate-producing potential of complex microbial communities from "-omics"-derived data. Furthermore, a reference data set containing the abundance and diversity of butyrate synthesis pathways from the healthy gut microbiota was established through a metagenomics-based assessment. This study will help in understanding the role of butyrate producers in health and disease and may assist the development of treatments for functional dysbiosis.},

abstract = {Cells need to adapt to dynamic environments. Yeast that fail to cope with dynamic changes in the abundance of glucose can undergo growth arrest. We show that this failure is caused by imbalanced reactions in glycolysis, the essential pathway in energy metabolism in most organisms. The imbalance arises largely from the fundamental design of glycolysis, making this state of glycolysis a generic risk. Cells with unbalanced glycolysis co-existed with vital cells. Spontaneous, non-genetic metabolic variability among individual cells determines which state is reached and consequently which cells survive. Transient ATP hydrolysis through futile cycling reduces the probability of reaching the imbalanced state. Our results reveal dynamic behavior of glycolysis and indicate that cell fate can be determined by heterogeneity purely at the metabolic level.},

abstract = {In this study, the authors investigated how the glycolytic flux was regulated in time upon nitrogen starvation of cells with different growth histories. We have compared cells grown in glucose-limited chemostat cultures under respiratory conditions (low dilution rate of 0.1/h) to cells grown under respirofermentative conditions (high dilution rate of 0.35/h). The fermentative capacity was lower in cells grown under respiratory conditions than in cells grown under respirofermentative conditions, yet more resilient to prolonged nitrogen starvation. The time profiles revealed that the fermentative capacity even increased in cells grown under respiratory conditions during the first hours of nitrogen starvation. In cells grown under respirofermentative conditions the fermentative capacity decreased from the onset of nitrogen starvation. We have applied time-dependent Regulation Analysis to follow the fermentative capacity during nitrogen starvation. In both experiments, diverse categories of regulation were found. However, in the cells grown under respiratory conditions regulation was predominantly metabolic, whereas in the cells grown under respirofermentative conditions hierarchical regulation was dominant. To study the metabolic regulation, concentrations of intracellular metabolites, including allosteric regulators, were measured. The obtained results can explain some aspects of the metabolic regulation, but not all.},

abstract = {We examine the application of the maximum entropy production principle for describing ecosystem biogeochemistry. Since ecosystems can be functionally stable despite changes in species composition, we use a distributed metabolic network for describing biogeochemistry, which synthesizes generic biological structures that catalyse reaction pathways, but is otherwise organism independent. Allocation of biological structure and regulation of biogeochemical reactions is determined via solution of an optimal control problem in which entropy production is maximized. However, because synthesis of biological structures cannot occur if entropy production is maximized instantaneously, we propose that information stored within the metagenome allows biological systems to maximize entropy production when averaged over time. This differs from abiotic systems that maximize entropy production at a point in space-time, which we refer to as the steepest descent pathway. It is the spatio-temporal averaging that allows biological systems to outperform abiotic processes in entropy production, at least in many situations. A simulation of a methanotrophic system is used to demonstrate the approach. We conclude with a brief discussion on the implications of viewing ecosystems as self-organizing molecular machines that function to maximize entropy production at the ecosystem level of organization.},

@article{Vallino1996,
abstract = {A bioenergetic model has been developed to examine growth kinetics associated with bacterial utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), NH4+, and NO3-. A set of 11 metabolic reactions are used to govern the incorporation, oxidation, and N remineralization of DOM and dissolved inorganic N associated with bacterial growth. For each reaction, free energies and electron transfer requirements are calculated based on the C, H, O, and N composition of the substrates and their concentration in the environment. From these reactions, an optimization problem is constructed in which bacterial growth rate is maximized subject to constraints on energetics, electron balances, substrate uptake kinetics, and bacterial C:N ratio. The optimization approach provides more information on bacterial growth kinetics than do the Monod-type models that are typically used to describe bacterial growth. Simulations are ran to examine bacterial C yield and growth rate, N remineralization or immobilization, and substrate preferences as resource concentrations and compositions are varied. Results from the model agree well with observations in the literature, which indicate that the premise of the model, that bacteria allocate resources to maximize growth rate, may be an accurate overall description of bacterial growth. Simulations indicate that bacterial growth rate and yield are strongly correlated to the oxidation state of the labile DOM, as determined from its bulk elemental composition. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that bacterial growth cannot always be explained by a single constraint (such as the C:N ratio of substrate), since several constraints are often active simultaneously and continuously change with environmental conditions.},

abstract = {A metabolic network can be described by a set of elementary modes or pathways representing discrete metabolic states that support cell function. We have recently shown that in the most likely metabolic state the usage probability of individual elementary modes is distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution law while complying with the principle of maximum entropy production. To demonstrate that a metabolic network evolves towards such state we have carried out adaptive evolution experiments with Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum operating with a reduced metabolic functionality based on a reduced set of elementary modes. In such reduced metabolic network metabolic fluxes can be conveniently computed from the measured metabolite secretion pattern. Over a time span of 300 generations the specific growth rate of the strain continuously increased together with a continuous increase in the rate of entropy production. We show that the rate of entropy production asymptotically approaches the maximum entropy production rate predicted from the state when the usage probability of individual elementary modes is distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, the outcome of evolution of a complex biological system can be predicted in highly quantitative terms using basic statistical mechanical principles. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms govern multiple aspects of animal metabolism. Transcriptome-, proteome- and metabolome-wide measurements have revealed widespread circadian rhythms in metabolism gov- erned by a cellular genetic oscillator, the circadian core clock. However, it remains unclear if and under which conditions tran- scriptional rhythms cause rhythms in particular metabolites and metabolic fluxes. Here, we analyzed the circadian orchestration of metabolic pathways by direct measurement of enzyme activi- ties, analysis of transcriptome data, and developing a theoretical method called circadian response analysis. Contrary to a common assumption, we found that pronounced rhythms in metabolic pathways are often favored by separation rather than alignment in the times of peak activity of key enzymes. This property holds true for a set of metabolic pathway motifs (e.g., linear chains and branching points) and also under the conditions of fast kinet- ics typical for metabolic reactions. By circadian response analysis of pathway motifs, we determined exact timing separation con- straints on rhythmic enzyme activities that allow for substantial rhythms in pathway flux and metabolite concentrations. Direct measurements of circadian enzyme activities in mouse skeletal muscle confirmed that such timing separation occurs in vivo.},

In nongrowing, anaerobic, compressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae the values of the kinetic parameters of most glycolytic enzymes were determined. For the other enzymes appropriate literature values were collected. By inserting these values into a kinetic model for glycolysis, fluxes and metabolites were calculated. Under the same conditions fluxes and metabolite levels were measured. In our first model, branch reactions were ignored. This model failed to reach the stable steady state that was observed in the experimental flux measurements. Introduction of branches towards trehalose, glycogen, glycerol and succinate did allow such a steady state. The predictions of this branched model were compared with the empirical behavior. Half of the enzymes matched their predicted flux in vivo within a factor of 2. For the other enzymes it was calculated what deviation between in vivo and in vitro kinetic characteristics could explain the discrepancy between in vitro rate and in vivo flux.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Computational modeling in metabolic engineering involves the prediction of genetic manipulations that would lead to optimized microbial strains, maximizing the production rate of chemicals of interest. Various computational methods are based on constraint-based modeling, which enables to anticipate the effect of genetic manipulations on cellular metabolism considering a genome-scale metabolic network. However, current methods do not account for the presence of competing pathways in a metabolic network that may diverge metabolic flux away from producing a required chemical, resulting in lower (or even zero) chemical production rates in reality-making these methods somewhat over optimistic. RESULTS In this article, we describe a novel constraint-based method called RobustKnock that predicts gene deletion strategies that lead to the over-production of chemicals of interest, by accounting for the presence of competing pathways in the network. We describe results of applying RobustKnock to Escherichia coli's metabolic network towards the production of various chemicals, demonstrating its ability to provide more robust predictions than those obtained via current state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Combinatorial approaches in metabolic engineering work by generating genetic diversity in a microbial population followed by screening for strains with improved phenotypes. One of the most common goals in this field is the generation of a high rate chemical producing strain. A major hurdle with this approach is that many chemicals do not have easy to recognize attributes, making their screening expensive and time consuming. To address this problem, it was previously suggested to use microbial biosensors to facilitate the detection and quantification of chemicals of interest. Here, we present novel computational methods to: (i) rationally design microbial biosensors for chemicals of interest based on substrate auxotrophy that would enable their high-throughput screening; (ii) predict engineering strategies for coupling the synthesis of a chemical of interest with the production of a proxy metabolite for which high-throughput screening is possible via a designed bio-sensor. The biosensor design method is validated based on known genetic modifications in an array of E. coli strains auxotrophic to various amino-acids. Predicted chemical production rates achievable via the biosensor-based approach are shown to potentially improve upon those predicted by current rational strain design approaches. (A Matlab implementation of the biosensor design method is available via http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/{\~{}}tomersh/tools).},

As well as inorganic phosphate, we employed the pH-sensitive NMR probe methylphosphonate, which was taken up by glycerol-grown cells and was nontoxic; its pKa of 7.65 made it an ideal probe for measurement of cytoplasmic pH and alkaline external pH.},

@article{Singh2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Targeting persistent tubercule bacilli has become an important challenge in the development of anti-tuberculous drugs. As the glyoxylate bypass is essential for persistent bacilli, interference with it holds the potential for designing new antibacterial drugs. We have developed kinetic models of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate bypass in Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and studied the effects of inhibition of various enzymes in the M. tuberculosis model.

RESULTS: We used E. coli to validate the pathway-modeling protocol and showed that changes in metabolic flux can be estimated from gene expression data. The M. tuberculosis model reproduced the observation that deletion of one of the two isocitrate lyase genes has little effect on bacterial growth in macrophages, but deletion of both genes leads to the elimination of the bacilli from the lungs. It also substantiated the inhibition of isocitrate lyases by 3-nitropropionate. On the basis of our simulation studies, we propose that: (i) fractional inactivation of both isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is required for a flux through the glyoxylate bypass in persistent mycobacteria; and (ii) increasing the amount of active isocitrate dehydrogenases can stop the flux through the glyoxylate bypass, so the kinase that inactivates isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and/or the proposed inactivator of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 is a potential target for drugs against persistent mycobacteria. In addition, competitive inhibition of isocitrate lyases along with a reduction in the inactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenases appears to be a feasible strategy for targeting persistent mycobacteria.

CONCLUSION: We used kinetic modeling of biochemical pathways to assess various potential anti-tuberculous drug targets that interfere with the glyoxylate bypass flux, and indicated the type of inhibition needed to eliminate the pathogen. The advantage of such an approach to the assessment of drug targets is that it facilitates the study of systemic effect(s) of the modulation of the target enzyme(s) in the cellular environment.},

We maintain the advantages of using the geneeralized degree of reduction while correcting for the large errors in teh principle of energy regularity, especially for small molecules and for nitrogen-source compounds. As a result, we obtain more accurate energy balances (heat loads) and second law constraints, and are able to clarify contradictory statments in the literature as to whether nonphotosynthetic fermentation processes can produce oxygen or absorb rather than produce heat. Indeed, the answers to such questions become evident using the classification system introduced here.},

abstract = {Purpose of review: Giardia intestinalis (syn. duodenalis or lamblia) is one of the most common intestinal parasites in the world, with an estimated 2.8 null 106 infections per year in humans, and it contributes to diarrhea and nutritional deficiencies in children in developing regions. The wide prevalence of Giardia and its unique place in evolutionary biology have led to ongoing research. Recent findings: Research into the basic biology of Giardia has highlighted some of its unique properties as an 'early-branching' eukaryote. Although Giardia do not contain mitochondria, they have developed pathways to perform some mitochondrial functions. Investigations into encystation and excystation have identified new gene products that are important in cyst wall formation, and signal transduction events that occur during excystation. The ability to transfect Giardia stably will lead to an improved understanding of its development and metabolism. Molecular typing of G. intestinalis isolates indicates that most animal parasites are not associated with human infection. Insights into immunology have helped define the role of IL-6 in the early control of murine giardiasis, and the contributions of IgA in controlling infection. Further studies of giardiasis in poorly nourished children in developing regions supports an important contributing role of Giardia in stunting and cognitive impairment. Finally, new diagnostic assays using antigen detection are being evaluated and a new agent, nitazoxanide, has been approved in the USA for the treatment of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis in children. Summary: Research into the biology of Giardia should increase knowledge about protist differentiation and will complement studies in other biological systems. Continued study of the role of Giardia in chronic diarrhea and malnutrition in developing regions will help focus strategies to improve childhood growth and nutrition.},

abstract = {Cyanobacterial regulation of gene expression must contend with a genome organization that lacks apparent functional context, as the majority of cellular processes and metabolic pathways are encoded by genes found at disparate locations across the genome and there exists relatively few transcription factors. In this study, global transcript abundance data from the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 grown under 42 different conditions was analyzed 25 using Context-Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR). The resulting network, organized into 11 2 modules, provided insight into transcriptional network topology as well as grouping genes by 6 27 28 function and linking their response to specific environmental variables. When used in conjunction with genome sequences the network allowed identification and expansion of novel 29 30 31 potential targets of both DNA binding proteins and sRNA regulators. These results offer a new perspective into the multi-level regulation that governs cellular adaptations of fast-growing physiologically robust cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 to changing environmental 32 33 variables. It also provides a methodological high-throughput approach to studying multi-scale regulatory mechanisms that operate in cyanobacteria. Finally, it provides valuable context for 34 35 integrating systems-level data to enhance gene grouping based on annotated function, especially in organisms where traditional context analyses cannot be implemented due to lack of operon- 36 based functional organization. 2},

abstract = {Articles have appeared that rely on the application of some form of "maximum local entropy production principle" (MEPP). This is usually an optimization principle that is supposed to compensate for the lack of structural information and measurements about complex systems, even systems as complex and as little characterized as the whole biosphere or the atmosphere of the Earth or even of less known bodies in the solar system. We select a number of claims from a few well-known papers that advocate this principle and we show that they are in error with the help of simple examples of well-known chemical and physical systems. These erroneous interpretations can be attributed to ignoring well-established and verified theoretical results such as (1) entropy does not necessarily increase in nonisolated systems, such as "local" subsystems; (2) macroscopic systems, as described by classical physics, are in general intrinsically deterministic-there are no "choices" in their evolution to be selected by using supplementary principles; (3) macroscopic deterministic systems are predictable to the extent to which their state and structure is sufficiently well-known; usually they are not sufficiently known, and probabilistic methods need to be employed for their prediction; and (4) there is no causal relationship between the thermodynamic constraints and the kinetics of reaction systems. In conclusion, any predictions based on MEPP-like principles should not be considered scientifically founded.},

We show how generic reversible rate equations can be recast in two ways, one making the distance from equilibrium explicit, thereby allowing the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control of reaction rate, as well as near-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium reactions. Recasting in the second form separates mass action from rate capacity and quantifies the degree to which intrinsic mass action contributes to reaction rate and how regulation of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction either enhances or counteracts this mass-action behavior. The contribution of enzyme binding to regulation is analyzed in detail for a number of enzyme-kinetic rate laws, including cooperative reactions.},

abstract = {The variational principles called maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum caliber (MaxCal) are reviewed. MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy S=-∑ipilog⁡pi and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

Our method shows how: (1) the noise in cycles increases with cycle size and decreases with the driving force that spins the cycle and (2) provides a recipe for estimating small-number features, such as probability of backward spin in small cycles, from experimental data. The back-spin probability diminishes exponentially with the deviation from equilibrium. We believe this method may also be useful for other few-particle nonequilibrium biochemical reaction systems.},

abstract = {Complex feedback systems are ubiquitous in biology. Modeling such systems with mass action laws or master equations requires information rarely measured directly. Thus rates and reaction topologies are often treated as adjustable parameters. Here we present a general stochastic modeling method for small chemical and biochemical systems with emphasis on feedback systems. The method, Maximum Caliber (MaxCal), is more parsimonious than others in constructing dynamical models requiring fewer model assumptions and parameters to capture the effects of feedback. MaxCal is the dynamical analogue of Maximum Entropy. It uses average rate quantities and correlations obtained from short experimental trajectories to construct dynamical models. We illustrate the method on the bistable genetic toggle switch. To test our method, we generate synthetic data from an underlying stochastic model. MaxCal reliably infers the statistics of the stochastic bistability and other full dynamical distributions of the simulated data, w...},

@article{Polynikis2009,
abstract = {A fundamental step in synthetic biology and systems biology is to derive appropriate mathematical models for the purposes of analysis and design. For example, to synthesize a gene regulatory network, the derivation of a mathematical model is important in order to carry out in silico investigations of the network dynamics and to investigate parameter variations and robustness issues. Different mathematical frameworks have been proposed to derive such models. In particular, the use of sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has been proposed to model the dynamics of the concentrations of mRNAs and proteins. These models are usually characterized by the presence of highly nonlinear Hill function terms. A typical simplification is to reduce the number of equations by means of a quasi-steady-state assumption on the mRNA concentrations. This yields a class of simplified ODE models. A radically different approach is to replace the Hill functions by piecewise-linear approximations [Casey, R., de Jong, H., Gouze , J.-L., 2006. Piecewise-linear models of genetic regulatory networks: equilibria and their stability. J. Math. Biol. 52 (1), 27-56]. A further modelling approach is the use of discrete-time maps [Coutinho, R., Fernandez, B., Lima, R., Meyroneinc, A., 2006. Discrete time piecewise affine models of genetic regulatory networks. J. Math. Biol. 52, 524-570] where the evolution of the system is modelled in discrete, rather than continuous, time. The aim of this paper is to discuss and compare these different modelling approaches, using a representative gene regulatory network. We will show that different models often lead to conflicting conclusions concerning the existence and stability of equilibria and stable oscillatory behaviours. Moreover, we shall discuss, where possible, the viability of making certain modelling approximations (e.g. quasi-steady-state mRNA dynamics or piecewise-linear approximations of Hill functions) and their effects on the overall system dynamics.},

@article{Penfield2003,
abstract = {In the last chapter, we discussed one technique of estimating the input probabilities of a process given that the output event is known. This technique, which relies on the use of Bayes' Theorem, only works if the process is lossless (in which case the input can be identified with certainty) or the a priori input probability distribution is assumed (in which case the technique refines the initial probability distribution to take account of the known output). The Principle of Maximum Entropy is a technique that can be used to estimate input probabilities more generally. The result is a probability distribution that is consistent with known constraints expressed in terms of averages, or expected values, of one or more quantities, but is otherwise as unbiased as possible. This principle is described first for the simple case of one constraint and three input events, in which case the technique can be carried out analytically. Then it is described more generally in Chapter 10. This principle has applications in many domains, but was originally motivated by statistical physics, which attempts to relate macroscopic, measurable properties of physical systems to a description at the atomic or molecular level. It can be used to approach physical systems from the point of view of information theory, because the probability distributions can be derived by avoiding the assumption that the observer has more information than is actually available. Information theory, particularly the definition of information in terms of probability distributions, provides a quantitative measure of ignorance (or uncertainty, or entropy) that can be maximized mathematically to find the probability distribution that is maximally unbiased.},

abstract = {The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components.},

abstract = {In metabolism, available free energy is limited and must be divided across pathway steps to maintain a negative [Delta]G throughout. For each reaction, [Delta]G is log proportional both to a concentration ratio (reaction quotient to equilibrium constant) and to a flux ratio (backward to forward flux). Here we use isotope labeling to measure absolute metabolite concentrations and fluxes in Escherichia coli, yeast and a mammalian cell line. We then integrate this information to obtain a unified set of concentrations and [Delta]G for each organism. In glycolysis, we find that free energy is partitioned so as to mitigate unproductive backward fluxes associated with [Delta]G near zero. Across metabolism, we observe that absolute metabolite concentrations and [Delta]G are substantially conserved and that most substrate (but not inhibitor) concentrations exceed the associated enzyme binding site dissociation constant (Km or Ki). The observed conservation of metabolite concentrations is consistent with an evolutionary drive to utilize enzymes efficiently given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints.},

abstract = {Background: Nearly all processes in living cells are pH dependent, which is why intracellular pH (pHi) is a tightly regulated physiological parameter in all cellular systems. However, in microbes such as yeast, pH i responds to extracellular conditions such as the availability of nutrients. This raises the question of how pHi dynamics affect cellular function. Scope of review: We discuss the control of pHi, and the regulation of processes by pHi, focusing on the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We aim to dissect the effects of pH i on various aspects of cell physiology, which are often intertwined. Our goal is to provide a broad overview of how pHi is controlled in yeast, and how pHi in turn controls physiology, in the context of both general cellular functioning as well as of cellular decision making upon changes in the cell's environment. Major conclusions: Besides a better understanding of the regulation of pHi, evidence for a signaling role of pHi is accumulating. We conclude that pHi responds to nutritional cues and relays this information to alter cellular make-up and physiology. The physicochemical properties of pH allow the signal to be fast, and affect multiple regulatory levels simultaneously. General significance: The mechanisms for regulation of processes by pHi are tightly linked to the molecules that are part of all living cells, and the biophysical properties of the signal are universal amongst all living organisms, and similar types of regulation are suggested in mammals. Therefore, dynamic control of cellular decision making by pHi is therefore likely a general trait.

abstract = {Persistent misconceptions existing for dozens of years and influencing progress in various fields of science are sometimes encountered in the scientific and especially, 
the popular-science literature. The present brief review deals with two such interrelated misconceptions (misunderstandings). The first misunderstanding: entropy is a measure of disorder. This is an old and very common opinion. The second misconception is that the entropy production minimizes in the evolution of nonequilibrium systems. However, as it has recently become clear, evolution (progress) in Nature demonstrates the opposite, 
i.e., maximization of the entropy production. The principal questions connected with this maximization are considered herein. The two misconceptions mentioned above can lead to the apparent contradiction between the conclusions of modern thermodynamics and the basic conceptions of evolution existing in biology. In this regard, the analysis of these issues seems extremely important and timely as it contributes to the deeper understanding of the laws of development of the surrounding World and the place of humans in it.},

abstract = {Chemical reactions are rearrangements of chemical bonds. Each atom in an educt molecule thus appears again in a specific position of one of the reaction products. This bijection between educt and product atoms is not reported by chemical reaction databases, however, so that the “Atom Mapping Problem” of finding this bijection is left as an important computational task for many practical applications in computational chemistry and systems biology. Elementary chemical reactions feature a cyclic imaginary transition state (ITS) that imposes additional restrictions on the bijection between educt and product atoms that are not taken into account by previous approaches. We demonstrate that Constraint Programming is well-suited to solving the Atom Mapping Problem in this setting. The performance of our approach is evaluated for a manually curated subset of chemical reactions from the KEGG database featuring various ITS cycle layouts and reaction mechanisms.},

abstract = {The oxidative degradation of organic matter is a key process in the biogeochemical functioning of the earth system. Quantitative models of organic matter degradation are therefore essential for understanding the chemical state and evolution of the Earth's near-surface environment, and to forecast the biogeochemical consequences of ongoing regional and global change. The complex nature of biologically produced organic matter represents a major obstacle to the development of such models, however. Here, we compare the energetics of the oxidative degradation of a large number of naturally occurring organic compounds. By relating the Gibbs energies of half reactions describing the complete mineralization of the compounds to their average nominal carbon oxidation state, it becomes possible to estimate the energetic potential of the compounds based on major element (C, H, N, O, P, S) ratios. The new energetic description of organic matter can be combined with bioenergetic theory to rationalize observed patterns in the decomposition of natural organic matter. For example, the persistence of cell membrane derived compounds and complex organics in anoxic settings is consistent with their limited catabolic potential under these environmental conditions. The proposed approach opens the way to include the thermodynamic properties of organic compounds in kinetic models of organic matter degradation.},

@article{Kummel2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of genome sequences for many organisms enabled the reconstruction of several genome-scale metabolic network models. Currently, significant efforts are put into the automated reconstruction of such models. For this, several computational tools have been developed that particularly assist in identifying and compiling the organism-specific lists of metabolic reactions. In contrast, the last step of the model reconstruction process, which is the definition of the thermodynamic constraints in terms of reaction directionalities, still needs to be done manually. No computational method exists that allows for an automated and systematic assignment of reaction directions in genome-scale models. RESULTS: We present an algorithm that - based on thermodynamics, network topology and heuristic rules - automatically assigns reaction directions in metabolic models such that the reaction network is thermodynamically feasible with respect to the production of energy equivalents. It first exploits all available experimentally derived Gibbs energies of formation to identify irreversible reactions. As these thermodynamic data are not available for all metabolites, in a next step, further reaction directions are assigned on the basis of network topology considerations and thermodynamics-based heuristic rules. Briefly, the algorithm identifies reaction subsets from the metabolic network that are able to convert low-energy co-substrates into their high-energy counterparts and thus net produce energy. Our algorithm aims at disabling such thermodynamically infeasible cyclic operation of reaction subnetworks by assigning reaction directions based on a set of thermodynamics-derived heuristic rules. We demonstrate our algorithm on a genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli. The introduced systematic direction assignment yielded 130 irreversible reactions (out of 920 total reactions), which corresponds to about 70{\%} of all irreversible reactions that are required to disable thermodynamically infeasible energy production. CONCLUSION: Although not being fully comprehensive, our algorithm for systematic reaction direction assignment could define a significant number of irreversible reactions automatically with low computational effort. We envision that the presented algorithm is a valuable part of a computational framework that assists the automated reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models.},

abstract = {As one of the most recent members of the omics family, large-scale quantitative metabolomics data are currently complementing our systems biology data pool and offer the chance to integrate the metabolite level into the functional analysis of cellular networks. Network-embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis) is presented as a framework for mechanistic and model-based analysis of these data. By coupling the data to an operating metabolic network via the second law of thermodynamics and the metabolites' Gibbs energies of formation, NET analysis allows inferring functional principles from quantitative metabolite data; for example it identifies reactions that are subject to active allosteric or genetic regulation as exemplified with quantitative metabolite data from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the optimization framework of NET analysis was demonstrated to be a valuable tool to systematically investigate data sets for consistency, for the extension of sub-omic metabolome data sets and for resolving intracompartmental concentrations from cell-averaged metabolome data. Without requiring any kind of kinetic modeling, NET analysis represents a perfectly scalable and unbiased approach to uncover insights from quantitative metabolome data.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The PM6 semiempirical method and the dispersion and hydrogen bond-corrected PM6-D3H+ method are used together with the SMD and COSMO continuum solvation models to predict pKa values of pyridines, alcohols, phenols, benzoic acids, carboxylic acids, and phenols using isodesmic reactions and compared to published ab initio results. The pKa values of pyridines, alcohols, phenols, and benzoic acids considered in this study can generally be predicted with PM6 and ab initio methods to within the same overall accuracy, with average mean absolute differences (MADs) of 0.6–0.7 pH units. For carboxylic acids, the accuracy (0.7–1.0 pH units) is also comparable to ab initio results if a single outlier is removed. For primary, secondary, and tertiary amines the accuracy is, respectively, similar (0.5–0.6), slightly worse (0.5–1.0), and worse (1.0–2.5), provided that di- and tri-ethylamine are used as reference molecules for secondary and tertiary amines. When applied to a drug-like molecule where an empirical pKa predictor exhibits a large (4.9 pH unit) error, we find that the errors for PM6-based predictions are roughly the same in magnitude but opposite in sign. As a result, most of the PM6-based methods predict the correct protonation state at physiological pH, while the empirical predictor does not. The computational cost is around 2–5 min per conformer per core processor, making PM6-based pKa prediction computationally efficient enough to be used for high-throughput screening using on the order of 100 core processors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {It is generally believed that water transport across biological membranes is essentially a near-instantaneous process, with water molecules diffusing directly across the membrane as well as through pores such as aquaporins. As a result of these processes by which water can equilibrate across a membrane, a common assumption is that intracellular water is isotopically indistinguishable from extracellular water. To test this assumption directly, we measured the hydrogen isotope ratio of intracellular water in Escherichia coli cells. Our results demonstrate that more than 50{\%} of the intracellular water hydrogen atoms in log-phase E. coli cells are isotopically distinct from the growth medium water and that these isotopically distinct hydrogen atoms are derived from metabolic processes. As expected, the (2)H/(1)H isotope ratio of intracellular water from log-phase cells showed an appreciably larger contribution from metabolic water than did intracellular water from stationary-phase cells (53 +/- 12 and 23 +/- 5{\%}, respectively). The (2)H/(1)H isotope ratio of intracellular water was also monitored indirectly by measuring the isotope ratio of fatty acids, metabolites that are known to incorporate hydrogen atoms from water during biosynthesis. Significantly, the difference in the isotopic composition of intracellular water from log- to stationary-phase E. coli cells was reflected in the hydrogen isotope ratio of individual fatty acids harvested at the two different times, indicating that the isotope ratio of metabolites can be used as an indirect probe of metabolic activity. Together, these results demonstrate that contrary to the common assumption that intracellular water is isotopically identical to extracellular water, these two pools of water can actually be quite distinct.},

abstract = {In contrast to stoichiometric-based models, the development of large-scale kinetic models of metabolism has been hindered by the challenge of identifying kinetic parameter values and kinetic rate laws applicable to a wide range of environmental and/or genetic perturbations. The recently introduced ensemble modeling (EM) procedure provides a promising remedy to address these challenges by decomposing metabolic reactions into elementary reaction steps and incorporating all phenotypic observations, upon perturbation, in its model parameterization scheme. Here, we present a kinetic model of Escherichia coli core metabolism that satisfies the fluxomic data for wild-type and seven mutant strains by making use of the EM concepts. This model encompasses 138 reactions, 93 metabolites and 60 substrate-level regulatory interactions accounting for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, major pyruvate metabolism, anaplerotic reactions and a number of reactions in other parts of the metabolism. Parameterization is performed using a formal optimization approach that minimizes the discrepancies between model predictions and flux measurements. The predicted fluxes by the model are within the uncertainty range of experimental flux data for 78{\%} of the reactions (with measured fluxes) for both the wild-type and seven mutant strains. The remaining flux predictions are mostly within three standard deviations of reported ranges. Converting the EM-based parameters into a Michaelis-Menten equivalent formalism revealed that 35{\%} of Km and 77{\%} of kcat parameters are within uncertainty range of the literature-reported values. The predicted metabolite concentrations by the model are also within uncertainty ranges of metabolomic data for 68{\%} of the metabolites. A leave-one-out cross-validation test to evaluate the flux prediction performance of the model showed that metabolic fluxes for the mutants located in the proximity of mutations used for training the model can be predicted more accurately. The constructed model and the parameterization procedure presented in this study pave the way for the construction of larger-scale kinetic models with more narrowly distributed parameter values as new metabolomic/fluxomic data sets are becoming available for E. coli and other organisms.},

abstract = {Redox biochemistry plays a key role in the transduction of chemical energy in all living systems. Observed redox reactions in metabolic networks represent only a minuscule fraction of the space of all possible redox reactions. Here we ask what distinguishes observed, natural redox biochemistry from the space of all possible redox reactions between natural and non-natural compounds. We generate the set of all possible biochemical redox reactions involving linear chain molecules with a fixed numbers of carbon atoms. Using cheminformatics and quantum chemistry tools we analyze the physicochemical and thermodynamic properties of natural and non-natural compounds and reactions. We find that among all compounds, aldose sugars are the ones with the highest possible number of connections (reductions and oxidations) to other molecules. Natural metabolites are significantly enriched in carboxylic acid functional groups and depleted in carbonyls and have significantly higher solubilities than non-natural compounds. Upon constructing a thermodynamic landscape for the full set of reactions as a function of pH and of steady-state redox cofactor potential, we find that, over this whole range of conditions, natural metabolites have significantly lower energies than the non-natural compounds. For the set of 4-carbon compounds, we generate a Pourbaix phase diagram to determine which metabolites are local energetic minima in the landscape as a function of pH and redox potential. Our results suggest that, across a set of conditions, succinate and butyrate are local minima and would thus tend to accumulate at equilibrium. Our work suggests that metabolic compounds could have been selected for thermodynamic stability, and yields insight into thermodynamic and design principles governing nature{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s metabolic redox reactions.},

abstract = {A new rate law of general form can be applied to predict rates of microbial respiration in various geochemical environments. Because it accounts for the energy available to a microbe, the rate law can be applied in over a spectrum of conditions, ranging from environments rich in chemical energy to those fully oligotrophic. Two sets of parameters, one related to thermodynamic constraints and the other set appearing in kinetic terms, need be determined to apply the new law. We show that the thermodynamic parameters can be estimated from knowledge of the details of a microbe's respiratory chain. The kinetic parameters are best determined by fitting the rate law to experimental observations. We find that for respiration characterized by a strong thermodynamic driving force, such as many types of aerobic respiration and denitrification, the kinetic controls on respiration rate almost invariably dominate. In such cases, the thermodynamic control can safely be ignored. For respiration utilizing less powerful thermodynamic driving forces, such as sulfate reduction and reductive methanogenesis, the thermodynamic control on respiration rate can be dominant. It is of critical importance in these cases to account for thermodynamic as well as kinetic controls when calculating respiration rates. Taking as examples methanogenesis and sulfate reduction in hydrothermal fluids, we show how the new rate law can be applied over a spectrum of conditions and energy availability.},

In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities.

Gibbs free energy contribution values were estimated for 74 distinct molecular substructures and 11 interaction factors using multiple linear regression against a training set of 645 reactions and 224 compounds. The standard error for the fitted values was 1.90 kcal/mol. Cross-validation analysis was utilized to determine the accuracy of the methodology in estimating Delta(r)G'(o) and Delta(f)G'(o) for reactions and compounds not included in the training set, and based on the results of the cross-validation, the standard error involved in these estimations is 2.22 kcal/mol.

Enzymes and their various func-tional states are represented explicitly as compounds, or nodes in a stoichiometric network, within this formalism. Analyses and simulations of MASS models explicitly show that regulatory enzymes can control dynamic states of networks in part by binding numerous metabolites at multiple sites. Thus, network functional states are reflected in the fractional states of a regulatory enzyme, such as the fraction of the total enzyme concentration that is in a catalytically active versus inactive state.

abstract = {'Bioimmobilization' of redox-sensitive heavy metals and radionuclides is being investigated as a way to remediate contaminated groundwater and sediments. In one approach, growth-limiting substrates are added to the subsurface to stimulate the activity of targeted groups of indigenous microorganisms and create conditions favorable for the microbially-mediated reductive precipitation ('bioreduction') of targeted contaminants. We present a theoretical framework for modeling this process that modifies conventional geochemical reaction path modeling to include thermodynamic descriptions for microbial growth and may be called biogeochemical reaction path modeling. In this approach, the actual microbial community is represented by a synthetic microbial community consisting of a collection of microbial groups; each with a unique growth equation that couples a specific pair of energy yielding redox reactions. The growth equations and their computed standard-state free energy yields are appended to the thermodynamic database used in conventional geochemical reaction path modeling, providing a direct coupling between chemical species participating in both microbial growth and geochemical reactions. To compute the biogeochemical reaction paths, growth substrates are reacted incrementally with the defined geochemical environment and the coupled equations are solved simultaneously to predict reaction paths that display changing microbial biomass, community composition (i.e. the fraction of total biomass in each microbial group), and the aqueous and mineral composition of the system, including aqueous speciation and oxidation state of the targeted contaminants. The approach, with growth equations derived from the literature using well-known bioenergetics principles, was used to predict the results of a laboratory microcosm experiment and an in situ field experiment that investigated the bioreduction of uranium. Predicted effects of ethanol or acetate addition on uranium concentration and speciation, major ion geochemistry, mineralogy, microbial biomass and community composition were in qualitative agreement with experimental observations although the available data precluded rigorous model testing. While originally developed for use in better understanding of bioimmobilization of heavy metals and radionuclides, the modeling approach is potentially useful for exploring the coupling of microbial growth and geochemical reactions in a variety of other basic and applied biotechnology research settings.},

abstract = {Cellular functions are ultimately linked to metabolic fluxes brought about by thousands of chemical reactions and transport processes. The synthesis of the underlying enzymes and membrane transporters causes the cell a certain 'effort' of energy and external resources. Considering that those cells should have had a selection advantage during natural evolution that enabled them to fulfil vital functions (such as growth, defence against toxic compounds, repair of DNA alterations, etc.) with minimal effort, one may postulate the principle of flux minimization, as follows: given the available external substrates and given a set of functionally important 'target' fluxes required to accomplish a specific pattern of cellular functions, the stationary metabolic fluxes have to become a minimum. To convert this principle into a mathematical method enabling the prediction of stationary metabolic fluxes, the total flux in the network is measured by a weighted linear combination of all individual fluxes whereby the thermodynamic equilibrium constants are used as weighting factors, i.e. the more the thermodynamic equilibrium lies on the right-hand side of the reaction, the larger the weighting factor for the backward reaction. A linear programming technique is applied to minimize the total flux at fixed values of the target fluxes and under the constraint of flux balance (= steady-state conditions) with respect to all metabolites. The theoretical concept is applied to two metabolic schemes: the energy and redox metabolism of erythrocytes, and the central metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The flux rates predicted by the flux-minimization method exhibit significant correlations with flux rates obtained by either kinetic modelling or direct experimental determination. Larger deviations occur for segments of the network composed of redundant branches where the flux-minimization method always attributes the total flux to the thermodynamically most favourable branch. Nevertheless, compared with existing methods of structural modelling, the principle of flux minimization appears to be a promising theoretical approach to assess stationary flux rates in metabolic systems in cases where a detailed kinetic model is not yet available.},

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models are an invaluable tool for analyzing metabolic systems as they provide a more complete picture of the processes of metabolism. We have constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli based on the iJR904 model developed by the Palsson Laboratory at the University of California at San Diego. Group contribution methods were utilized to estimate the standard Gibbs free energy change of every reaction in the constructed model. Reactions in the model were classified based on the activity of the reactions during optimal growth on glucose in aerobic media. The most thermodynamically unfavorable reactions involved in the production of biomass in E. coli were identified as ATP phosphoribosyltransferase, ATP synthase, methylene-tetra-hydrofolate dehydrogenase, and tryptophanase. The effect of a knockout of these reactions on the production of biomass and the production of individual biomass precursors was analyzed. Changes in the distribution of fluxes in the cell after knockout of these unfavorable reactions were also studied. The methodologies and results discussed can be used to facilitate the refinement of the feasible ranges for cellular parameters such as species concentrations and reaction rate constants.},

abstract = {This pioneering graduate textbook provides readers with the concepts and practical tools required to understand the maximum entropy principle, and apply it to an understanding of ecological patterns. Rather than building and combining mechanistic models of ecosystems, the approach is grounded in information theory and the logic of inference. Paralleling the derivation of thermodynamics from the maximum entropy principle, the state variable theory of ecology developed in this book predicts realistic forms for all metrics of ecology that describe patterns in the distribution, abundance, and energetics of species over multiple spatial scales, a wide range of habitats, and diverse taxonomic groups. The first part of the book is foundational, discussing the nature of theory, the relationship of ecology to other sciences, and the concept of the logic of inference. Subsequent sections present the fundamentals of macroecology and of maximum information entropy, starting from first principles. The core of the book integrates these fundamental principles, leading to the derivation and testing of the predictions of the maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE). A final section broadens the book's perspective by showing how METE can help clarify several major issues in conservation biology, placing it in context with other theories and highlighting avenues for future research.},

The problems solved concern two enzyme-catalyzed reaction systems that obey diversely modified Michaelis–Menten rate equations, and biomolecule surface binding that is limited by mass transport. These problems involve the solutions of transcendental equations that include products of variables and their logarithms. Such equations are solvable by the use of the Lambert W(x) function. Thus, these standard kinetics examples are solved in terms of W(x) to show the applicability of this commonly unknown function to the biochemical community. Hence, this review first of all describes the mathematical definition and properties of the W(x) function and its numerical evaluations, together with analytical approximations, and then it describes the use of the W(x) function in biochemical kinetics. Other applications of the function in various engineering sciences are also cited, although not described.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Geobacter sulfurreducens is a member of the Geobacter species, which are capable of oxidation of organic waste coupled to the reduction of heavy metals and electrode with applications in bioremediation and bioenergy generation. While the metabolism of this organism has been studied through the development of a stoichiometry based genome-scale metabolic model, the associated regulatory network has not yet been well studied. In this manuscript, we report on the implementation of a thermodynamics based metabolic flux model for Geobacter sulfurreducens. We use this updated model to identify reactions that are subject to regulatory control in the metabolic network of G. sulfurreducens using thermodynamic variability analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: As a first step, we have validated the regulatory sites and bottleneck reactions predicted by the thermodynamic flux analysis in E. coli by evaluating the expression ranges of the corresponding genes. We then identified ten reactions in the metabolic network of G. sulfurreducens that are predicted to be candidates for regulation. We then compared the free energy ranges for these reactions with the corresponding gene expression fold changes under conditions of different environmental and genetic perturbations and show that the model predictions of regulation are consistent with data. In addition, we also identify reactions that operate close to equilibrium and show that the experimentally determined exchange coefficient (a measure of reversibility) is significant for these reactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Application of the thermodynamic constraints resulted in identification of potential bottleneck reactions not only from the central metabolism but also from the nucleotide and amino acid subsystems, thereby showing the highly coupled nature of the thermodynamic constraints. In addition, thermodynamic variability analysis serves as a valuable tool in estimating the ranges of DeltarG' of every reaction in the model leading to the prediction of regulatory sites in the metabolic network, thereby characterizing the regulatory network in both a model organism such as E. coli as well as a non model organism such as G. sulfurreducens.},

abstract = {Mathematical and computational modelling of biochemical networks is often done in terms of either the concentrations of molecular species or the fluxes of biochemical reactions. When is mathematical modelling from either perspective equivalent to the other? Mathematical duality translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one manner. We present a novel stoichiometric condition that is necessary and sufficient for duality between unidirectional fluxes and concentrations. Our numerical experiments, with computational models derived from a range of genome-scale biochemical networks, suggest that this flux-concentration duality is a pervasive property of biochemical networks. We also provide a combinatorial characterisation that is sufficient to ensure flux-concentration duality.The condition prescribes that, for every two disjoint sets of molecular species, there is at least one reaction complex that involves species from only one of the two sets. When unidirectional fluxes and molecular species concentrations are dual vectors, this implies that the behaviour of the corresponding biochemical network can be described entirely in terms of either concentrations or unidirectional fluxes.},

abstract = {The quantitative analysis of biochemical reactions and metabolites is at frontier of biological sciences. The recent availability of high-throughput technology data sets in biology has paved the way for new modelling approaches at various levels of complexity including the metabolome of a cell or an organism. Understanding the metabolism of a single cell and multi-cell organism will provide the knowledge for the rational design of growth conditions to produce commercially valuable reagents in biotechnology. Here, we demonstrate how equations representing steady state mass conservation, energy conservation, the second law of thermodynamics, and reversible enzyme kinetics can be formulated as a single system of linear equalities and inequalities, in addition to linear equalities on exponential variables. Even though the feasible set is non-convex, the reformulation is exact and amenable to large-scale numerical analysis, a prerequisite for computationally feasible genome scale modelling. Integrating flux, concentration and kinetic variables in a unified constraint-based formulation is aimed at increasing the quantitative predictive capacity of flux balance analysis. Incorporation of experimental and theoretical bounds on thermodynamic and kinetic variables ensures that the predicted steady state fluxes are both thermodynamically and biochemically feasible. The resulting in silico predictions are tested against fluxomic data for central metabolism in Escherichia coli and compare favourably with in silico prediction by flux balance analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constraint-based analysis of genome-scale metabolic models has become a key methodology to gain insights into functions, capabilities, and properties of cellular metabolism. Since their inception, the size and complexity of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions has significantly increased, with a concomitant increase in computational effort required for their analysis. Many stoichiometric methods cannot be applied to large networks comprising several thousand reactions. Furthermore, basic principles of an organism's metabolism can sometimes be easier studied in smaller models focusing on central metabolism. Therefore, an automated and unbiased reduction procedure delivering meaningful core networks from well-curated genome-scale reconstructions is highly desirable.

RESULTS: Here we present NetworkReducer, a new algorithm for an automated reduction of metabolic reconstructions to obtain smaller models capturing the central metabolism or other metabolic modules of interest. The algorithm takes as input a network model and a list of protected elements and functions (phenotypes) and applies a pruning step followed by an optional compression step. Network pruning removes elements of the network that are dispensable for the protected functions and delivers a subnetwork of the full system. Loss-free network compression further reduces the network size but not the complexity (dimension) of the solution space. As a proof of concept, we applied NetworkReducer to the iAF1260 genome-scale model of Escherichia coli (2384 reactions, 1669 internal metabolites) to obtain a reduced model that (i) allows the same maximal growth rates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as in the full model, and (ii) preserves a protected set of reactions representing the central carbon metabolism. The reduced representation comprises 85 metabolites and 105 reactions which we compare to a manually derived E. coli core model. As one particular strength of our approach, NetworkReducer derives a condensed biomass synthesis reaction that is consistent with the full genome-scale model. In a second case study, we reduced a genome-scale model of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to obtain a small metabolic module comprising photosynthetic core reactions and the Calvin-Benson cycle allowing synthesis of both biomass and a biofuel (ethanol).

CONCLUSION: Although only genome-scale models provide a complete description of an organism's metabolic capabilities, an unbiased stoichiometric reduction of large-scale metabolic models is highly useful. We are confident that the NetworkReducer algorithm provides a valuable tool for the application of computationally expensive analyses, for educational purposes, as well to identify core models for kinetic modeling and isotopic tracer experiments.},

@article{Ebeling2006,
abstract = {In intensive aquaculture systems, ammonia–nitrogen buildup from the metabolism of feed is usually the second limiting factor to increase production levels after dissolved oxygen. The three nitrogen conversion pathways traditionally used for the removal of ammonia–nitrogen in aquaculture systems are photoautotrophic removal by algae, autotrophic bacterial conversion of ammonia–nitrogen to nitrate–nitrogen, and heterotrophic bacterial conversion of ammonia–nitrogen directly to microbial biomass. Traditionally, pond aquaculture has used photoautotrophic algae based systems to control inorganic nitrogen buildup. Currently, the primary strategy in intensive recirculating production systems for controlling ammonia–nitrogen is using large fixed-cell bioreactors. This option utilizes chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria, Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) and Nitrite Oxidizing Bacteria (NOB), for the nitrification of ammonia–nitrogen to nitrite–nitrogen and finally to nitrate–nitrogen. In the past several years, zero-exchange management systems have been developed that are based on heterotrophic bacteria and have been promoted for the intensive production of marine shrimp. In this third pathway, heterotrophic bacterial growth is stimulated through the addition of organic carbonaceous substrate. At high carbon to nitrogen (C/N) feed ratios, heterotrophic bacteria will assimilate ammonia–nitrogen directly into cellular protein. This paper reviews these three ammonia removal pathways, develops a set of stoichiometric balanced relationships using half-reaction relationships, and discusses their impact on water quality. In addition, microbial growth fundamentals are used to characterize production of volatile and total suspended solids for autotrophic and heterotrophic systems.},

abstract = {Recently the author used an information theoretical formulation of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics (MaxEnt) to derive the fluctuation theorem (FT) concerning the probability of second law violating phase-space paths. A less rigorous argument leading to the variational principle of maximum entropy production (MEP) was also given. Here a more rigorous and general mathematical derivation of MEP from MaxEnt is presented, and the relationship between MEP and the FT is thereby clarified. Specifically, it is shown that the FT allows a general orthogonality property of maximum information entropy to be extended to entropy production itself, from which MEP then follows. The new derivation highlights MEP and the FT as generic properties of MaxEnt probability distributions involving anti-symmetric constraints, independently of any physical interpretation. Physically, MEP applies to the entropy production of those macroscopic fluxes that are free to vary under the imposed constraints, and corresponds to selection of the most probable macroscopic flux configuration. In special cases MaxEnt also leads to various upper bound transport principles. The relationship between MaxEnt and previous theories of irreversible processes due to Onsager, Prigogine and Ziegler is also clarified in the light of these results.},

abstract = {The operation of biological systems is constrained under all circumstances by the laws of physics. Thermodynamics, in particular, dictates preferential directions in which biochemical reactions should flow at stationarity. When applied to cellular reaction systems (like metabolic networks), it favors the emergence of some (thermodynamically feasible) ways to organize the flow of matter while prohibiting others. The development of detailed predictive models for the biochemical activity of a cell relies on the possibility to integrate the laws of thermodynamics in genome-scale reconstructions of cellular metabolic networks. In this work we have devised an efficient relaxation algorithm to implement thermodynamic constraints in genome-scale models. Besides allowing to check for thermodynamic feasibility of reaction flow configurations, it is also capable of providing information on other relevant physico-chemical quantities. We have applied it to two cellular metabolic networks of different complexity, namely that of human red blood cells and that of the bacterium Escherichia coli. In the former case, we have obtained predictions for the intracellular chemical state (in terms of metabolite concentrations and reaction free energies) consistent with empirical knowledge; in the latter, we have effectively corrected thermodynamically infeasible flux configurations.},

Minimal cut sets (MCSs) were initially developed from the metabolic pathway analysis method (MPA) of elementary modes (EMs); they provide a way of identifying target genes for eliminating a certain objective function from a holistic perspective that takes into account the structure of the whole metabolic network. The concept of MCSs is fairly new and still being explored and developed; the initial concept has developed into a generalized form and its similarity to other network characterizations are discussed. MCSs can be used in conjunction with other constraints-based methods to get a better understanding of the capability of metabolic networks and the interrelationship between metabolites and enzymes/genes. The concept could play an important role in systems biology by contributing to fields such as metabolic and genetic engineering where it could assist in finding ways of producing industrially relevant compounds from renewable resources, not only for economical, but also for sustainability, reasons.},

For a simple two-state model of glycolysis, we explicitly derive analytic equations for hard trade-offs between robustness and efficiency with oscillations as an inevitable side effect. The model describes how the trade-offs arise from individual parameters, including the interplay of feedback control with autocatalysis of network products necessary to power and catalyze intermediate reactions. We then use control theory to prove that the essential features of these hard trade-off "laws" are universal and fundamental, in that they depend minimally on the details of this system and generalize to the robust efficiency of any autocatalytic network. The theory also suggests worst-case conditions that are consistent with initial experiments.},

abstract = {Motivation: In a genome-scale metabolic model, the biomass produced is defined to have a molecu- lar weight of 1 g mmol-1. This is critical for correctly predicting growth yields, contrasting multiple models and more importantly modeling microbial communities. However, the standard is rarely veri- fied in the current practice and the chemical formulae of biomass components such as proteins, nu- cleic acids and lipids are often represented by undefined side groups (e.g., X, R). Results: We introduced a systematic procedure for checking the biomass weight and ensuring com- plete mass balance of a model. We identified significant departures after examining 64 published models. The biomass weights of 34 models differed by 5 – 50{\%}, while 8 models have discrepancies {\textgreater}50{\%}. 20 models were manually curated. By maximizing the original vs. corrected biomass reactions, flux balance analysis revealed {\textgreater}10{\%} differences in growth yields for 12 of the curated models. Bio- mass molecular weight discrepancies are accentuated in microbial community simulations as they can cause significant and systematic errors in the community composition. Microbes with underesti- mated biomass molecular weights are overpredicted in the community whereas microbes with over- estimated biomass weights are underpredicted. The observed departures in community composition are disproportionately larger than the discrepancies in the biomass weight estimate. We propose the presented procedure as a standard practice for metabolic reconstructions.},

@book{Boyd2010,
abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57{\%}, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {Absolute metabolite concentrations are critical to a quantitative understanding of cellular metabolism, as concentrations impact both the free energies and rates of metabolic reactions. Here we use LC-MS/MS to quantify more than 100 metabolite concentrations in aerobic, exponentially growing Escherichia coli with glucose, glycerol or acetate as the carbon source. The total observed intracellular metabolite pool was approximately 300 mM. A small number of metabolites dominate the metabolome on a molar basis, with glutamate being the most abundant. Metabolite concentration exceeds Km for most substrate-enzyme pairs. An exception is lower glycolysis, where concentrations of intermediates are near the Km of their consuming enzymes and all reactions are near equilibrium. This may facilitate efficient flux reversibility given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints. The data and analyses presented here highlight the ability to identify organizing metabolic principles from systems-level absolute metabolite concentration data.},

Computational tools for predicting fluxes in biochemical networks are applied in the fields of integrated and systems biology, bioinformatics, and genomics, and to aid in drug discovery and identification of potential drug targets. Approaches, such as flux balance analysis (FBA), that account for the known stoichiometry of the reaction network while avoiding implementation of detailed reaction kinetics are promising tools for the analysis of large complex networks. Here we introduce energy balance analysis (EBA)--the theory and methodology for enforcing the laws of thermodynamics in such simulations--making the results more physically realistic and revealing greater insight into the regulatory and control mechanisms operating in complex large-scale systems. We show that EBA eliminates thermodynamically infeasible results associated with FBA.},

abstract = {When Streptococcus faecalis was grown anaerobically in a complex medium containing d-glucose, d-ribose or l-arginine as energy source the dry wt. of organism produced was proportional to the concentration of the energy source in the medium. However, S. faecalis will not grow in a defined medium with arginine as the energy source unless glucose is present at the same time. The anaerobic growth of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pseudomonas lindneri was proportional to the concentration of glucose in the medium and the yield coefficient—defined as g. dry wt. organism/mole glucose—of the former was the same as that of S. faecalis grown upon glucose and approximately twice that of P. lindneri. Calculation of the g. dry wt. organism/mole adenosine triphosphate synthesized for these three organisms gave values ranging from 12.6 to 8.3 with an average of 10.5. These results suggest that, under anaerobic conditions, the yield of S. faecalis, S. cerevisiae and P. lindneri was proportional to the amount of ATP synthesized. When Propionibacterium pentosaceum was grown anaerobically with glucose, glycerol or dl-lactate as energy source there was, in all three cases, a linear relationship between the dry wt. of organisms produced and the concentration of the energy source in the medium. The values of the yield coefficients obtained were compatible with the formation of approximately 4 mole ATP/mole glucose, 2 mole ATP/mole glycerol and 1 mole ATP/mole lactate.},

abstract = {Understanding how the homeostasis of cellular size and composition is accomplished by different organisms is an outstanding challenge in biology. For exponentially growing Escherichia coli cells, it is long known that the size of cells exhibits a strong positive relation with their growth rates in different nutrient conditions. Here, we characterized cell sizes in a set of orthogonal growth limitations. We report that cell size and mass exhibit positive or negative dependences with growth rate depending on the growth limitation applied. In particular, synthesizing large amounts of "useless" proteins led to an inversion of the canonical, positive relation, with slow growing cells enlarged 7- to 8-fold compared to cells growing at similar rates under nutrient limitation. Strikingly, this increase in cell size was accompanied by a 3- to 4-fold increase in cellular DNA content at slow growth, reaching up to an amount equivalent to {\~{}}8 chromosomes per cell. Despite drastic changes in cell mass and macromolecular composition, cellular dry mass density remained constant. Our findings reveal an important role of protein synthesis in cell division control.},

abstract = {This book is about the thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that make up the metabolism of living organisms. It is not an introductory text, but the fundamental principles of thermodynamics are reviewed. The reader does need some background in thermodynamics, such as that provided by a first course in physical chemistry. The book uses a generalized approach to thermodynamics that makes it possible to calculate the effects of changing pH, free concenrations of metal ions that are bound by reactants, and steady-state concentrations of coenzymes. This approach can be extended to other types of work that may be involved in a living organism. The concepts involved in this approach are simple, but the equations become rather complicated. Biochemical reactions are written in terms of reactants like ATP that are made up of sums of species, and they are referred to as biochemical reactions to differentiate them from the underlying chemical reactions that are written in terms of species. The thermodynamics of biochemical reactions is independent of the properties of the enzymes that catalyze them. However, the fact that enzymes may couple reactions that might otherwise occur separately increases the number of constraints that have to be considered in thermodynamics. Biochemical thermodynamics is complicated for several reasons: (1) Bio- chemical reactants consist of sums of species whenever a reactant has a pK within about two units of the pH of interest or binds metal ions reversibly. (2) Species of a biochemical reactant are often ions, and the activity coefficients of ions are functions of ionic strength. (3) Enzyme catalysis may introduce constraints in biochemical reactions in addition to balances of atoms of elements. (4) Metab- olism is sufficiently complicated that it is important to find ways to obtain a more global view. (5) In biochemistry other kinds of work, such as electric work, elongation work, and surface work may be involved. It is remarkable that the same basic reactions are found in all living systems. The most important thing about these reactions is that they provide the means to carry out the oxidation of organic matter in a sequence of steps that store energy that is needed for the synthesis of organic molecules, mechanical work, and other functions required for life. The theme of this book is that Legendre transforms make the application of thermodynamics more convenient for the users. The logic used here is a continu- ation of the process described by Gibbs that introduced the enthalpy H, Helmholtz energy A, and the Gibbs energy G by use of Legendre transforms of the internal energy U.In Chapter 4 a Legendre transform is used to introduce pH and pMg as independent intensive variables. In Chapter 6 the steady-state concentrations of various coenzymes are introduced as independent intensive variables in discussing systems of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In Chapter 8 a Legendre transform is used to introduce the electric potential of a phase as an independent intensive variable. These uses of Legendre transforms illustrate the comment by Callen (1985)that "The choice of variables in terms of which a given problem is formulated, while a seemingly innocuous step, is often the most crucial step in the solution." Choices of dependent and independent variables are not unique, and so choices can be made to suit the convenience of the experimenter. Gibbs has provided a mathematical structure for thermodynamics that is expand- able in many directions and is rich in interrelationships between measurable properties because thermodynamic properties obey all the rules of calculus. This book on thermodynamics differs from others in its emphasis on the fundamental equations of thermodynamics and the application of these equations to systems of biochemical reactions. The emphasis on fundamental equations leads to new thermodynamic potentials that provide criteria for spontaneous change and equilibrium under the conditions in a living cell. The equilibrium composition of a reaction system involving one or more enzyme-catalyzed reactions usually depends on the pH, and so the Gibbs energy G does not provide the criterion for spontaneous change and equilibrium. It is necessary to use a Legendre transform to define a transformed Gibbs energy G' that provides the criterion for spontaneous change and equilibrium at the specified pH. This process brings in a transformed entropy S' and a transformed enthalpy H', but this new world of thermodynamics is similar to the familiar world of G, S, and H, in spite of the fact that there are significant differences. Since coenzymes, and perhaps other reactants, are in steady states in living cells, it is of interest to use a Legendre transform to define a further transformed Gibbs energy G" that provides the criterion for spontaneous change and equilib- rium at a specified pH and specified concentrations of coenzymes.

abstract = {This book is about the thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that make up the metabolism of living organisms. It is not an introductory text, but the fundamental principles of thermodynamics are reviewed. The reader does need some background in thermodynamics, such as that provided by a first course in physical chemistry. The book uses a generalized approach to thermodynamics that makes it possible to calculate the effects of changing pH, free concenrations of metal ions that are bound by reactants, and steady-state concentrations of coenzymes. This approach can be extended to other types of work that may be involved in a living organism. The concepts involved in this approach are simple, but the equations become rather complicated. Biochemical reactions are written in terms of reactants like ATP that are made up of sums of species, and they are referred to as biochemical reactions to differentiate them from the underlying chemical reactions that are written in terms of species. The thermodynamics of biochemical reactions is independent of the properties of the enzymes that catalyze them. However, the fact that enzymes may couple reactions that might otherwise occur separately increases the number of constraints that have to be considered in thermodynamics. Biochemical thermodynamics is complicated for several reasons: (1) Bio- chemical reactants consist of sums of species whenever a reactant has a pK within about two units of the pH of interest or binds metal ions reversibly. (2) Species of a biochemical reactant are often ions, and the activity coefficients of ions are functions of ionic strength. (3) Enzyme catalysis may introduce constraints in biochemical reactions in addition to balances of atoms of elements. (4) Metab- olism is sufficiently complicated that it is important to find ways to obtain a more global view. (5) In biochemistry other kinds of work, such as electric work, elongation work, and surface work may be involved. It is remarkable that the same basic reactions are found in all living systems. The most important thing about these reactions is that they provide the means to carry out the oxidation of organic matter in a sequence of steps that store energy that is needed for the synthesis of organic molecules, mechanical work, and other functions required for life. The theme of this book is that Legendre transforms make the application of thermodynamics more convenient for the users. The logic used here is a continu- ation of the process described by Gibbs that introduced the enthalpy H, Helmholtz energy A, and the Gibbs energy G by use of Legendre transforms of the internal energy U.In Chapter 4 a Legendre transform is used to introduce pH and pMg as independent intensive variables. In Chapter 6 the steady-state concentrations of various coenzymes are introduced as independent intensive variables in discussing systems of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In Chapter 8 a Legendre transform is used to introduce the electric potential of a phase as an independent intensive variable. These uses of Legendre transforms illustrate the comment by Callen (1985)that "The choice of variables in terms of which a given problem is formulated, while a seemingly innocuous step, is often the most crucial step in the solution." Choices of dependent and independent variables are not unique, and so choices can be made to suit the convenience of the experimenter. Gibbs has provided a mathematical structure for thermodynamics that is expand- able in many directions and is rich in interrelationships between measurable properties because thermodynamic properties obey all the rules of calculus. This book on thermodynamics differs from others in its emphasis on the fundamental equations of thermodynamics and the application of these equations to systems of biochemical reactions. The emphasis on fundamental equations leads to new thermodynamic potentials that provide criteria for spontaneous change and equilibrium under the conditions in a living cell. The equilibrium composition of a reaction system involving one or more enzyme-catalyzed reactions usually depends on the pH, and so the Gibbs energy G does not provide the criterion for spontaneous change and equilibrium. It is necessary to use a Legendre transform to define a transformed Gibbs energy G' that provides the criterion for spontaneous change and equilibrium at the specified pH. This process brings in a transformed entropy S' and a transformed enthalpy H', but this new world of thermodynamics is similar to the familiar world of G, S, and H, in spite of the fact that there are significant differences. Since coenzymes, and perhaps other reactants, are in steady states in living cells, it is of interest to use a Legendre transform to define a further transformed Gibbs energy G" that provides the criterion for spontaneous change and equilib- rium at a specified pH and specified concentrations of coenzymes. This process brings in a further transformed entropy S" and a further transformed enthalpy H", but the relations between these properties have the familiar form. Quantitative calculations on systems of biochemical reactions are sufficiently complicated that it is necessary to use a personal computer with a mathematical application. Mathematica'{\~{}}'"(Wolfram Research, Inc. 100 World Trade Center, Champaign, IL, 61820-7237)is well suited for these purposes and is used in this book to make calculations, construct tables and figures, and solve problems. The last third of the book provides a computer-readable database, programs, and worked-out solutions to computer problems. The database BasicBiochemData2 is available on the Web at http:,'/www.mathsource.com/cgi-bin/msitem?O211-662. Systems of biochemical reactions can be represented by stoichiometric num- ber matrices and conservation matrices, which contain the same information and can be interconverted by use of linear algebra. Both are needed. The advantage of writing computer programs in terms of matrices is that they can then be used with larger systems without change. This field owes a tremendous debt to the experimentalists who have measured apparent equilibrium constants and heats of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and to those who have made previous thermodynamic tables that contain information needed in biochemical thermodynamics. Although I have been involved with the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions since 1950,I did not understand the usefulness of Legendre transforms until 1 had spent the decade of the 1980s working on the thermodynamics of petroleum processing. During this period I learned from Irwin Oppenheim (MIT) and Fred Krambeck (Mobil Research and Development) about Legendre trans- forms, calculations using matrices, and semigrand partition functions. In the 1990s 1 returned to biochemical thermodynamics and profited from many helpful},
